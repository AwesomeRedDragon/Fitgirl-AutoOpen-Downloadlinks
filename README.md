# Fitgirl-AutoOpen-Downloadlinks
Automatically opens all fuckingfast.co links on fitgirl's pastebin when opened

These are tampermonkey scripts. Install the tampermonkey extension, then make two userscripts with this code (Don't know if there's a proper way to export them, but it's fine, it's two scripts). You will need to allow your browser to run pop-ups from those pages, and there may be issues with having too many pop-ups. I have this on firefox, so I can only give the firefox solution:
Go to a new tab, and type in about:config as if it's a webpage. Search for a setting called dom_popup_maximum. Change the value to whatever you'd like. I set mine to 500, since I think the most parts I've seen is 133, which would be 400 popups (133 from the pastebin, 2 for each fuckingfast.co page), leaving me with plenty of room to spare.

Enjoy!
